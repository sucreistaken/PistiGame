piştiolsun
Pişti is a card game played by 2 or 4 people. It is very common in Turkey and one of the
easiest games to learn and play. Read this description carefully, it is written to answer all of
your questions.
This project is about the Pişti game played by two players: the computer versus the human
player.
The Game
A game card deck has four suits:
● Spades: ♠
● Clubs: ♣
● Hearts: ♥
● Diamonds: ♦
Each suit has 13 cards: A (Ace), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J (Jack), Q (Queen), K (King).
Therefore the deck has 52 cards.
In the game one of the players is the dealer - the dealer shuffles the cards and asks the other
player to cut them. Cutting cards is done by splitting the deck into two parts, and placing the
bottom part on the top part.
Now that the cards are ready, the dealer starts dealing the cards: one to the player, one to self,
until each has four cards. Then, the dealer places four cards on the board. These cards are
stacked - that is, they are not side by side, but placed on top of each other.
The game is played by taking turns. The player starts the game and is expected to place one
of his cards on top of the board. While doing so, he is allowed to take all the cards from the
board if the cards have the same value. If the top card is ♣7 and the player has a 7 from any
suit, then the player can play the 7, and take all the cards.
The name “pişti” comes from a case where there is a single card on the board, and one of the
players has the same card. For example, there is a single card, ♥4 on the board, and one of the
players has a four from any suit, then the player can make a “pişti” and score 10 points.
Talking about “points,” two cards have additional points: ♦10 is 3 points and ♣2 is 2 points.
All other cards are 1 point each. Once all cards are played, the player who has more cards
gets an additional 3 points.
The “Jack” of any suit has a special power. This card can take all the cards from the board
without taking the value of the top card into account.
If there are cards left on the board once all the cards are played, the last player who got the
cards from the board also gets the remaining ones.
Basically, the game is to get all the cards on the board either by using a Jack or by using a
card that has the same value as the top card on the board.
A Sample Game
The cards are shuffled and then cut. The table shows the board by placing the top card on the
first line, and the remaining cards on the second line. We can never see the opponent cards.
Turn My Hand Board Comment
1 ♠10 ♣A ♥3 ♦3 ♣4
♣3 ♣2 ♥A
Since I don’t have a four,
I play one of the 3s.
♠10 ♣A ♦3 ♥3
♣4 ♣3 ♣2 ♥A
Now the opponent will
play. Hint: Since there are
four 3s in the deck, it is
very likely that the
opponent will be playing
a three.
♠10 ♣A ♦3 ♣10
♥3 ♣4 ♣3 ♣2 ♥A
Now that the player has
played, and cannot take
any cards, it is my turn
again. I’ll be playing my
10, and I will get all the
cards. One of the cards is
♣2 - so I’m happy.
2 ♣A ♦3 ♠10
♣10 ♥3 ♣4 ♣3 ♣2 ♥A
Since I was able to play a
10, I’ll get all the cards.
The board will be empty.
♣A ♦3 Now it is time for the
opponent to play.
♣A ♦3 ♦A It must be my lucky day.
An ace is played, and
now I can make a “pişti”
3 ♦3 ♣A
♦A
Pişti! The board is once
again empty.
♦3 Now it is time for the
opponent to play.
♦3 ♠7 Nothing to do, I will play
my only remaining card.
4 ♦3
♠7
Card played, it is the
opponent’s turn.
♠8 Now both players are out
♦3 ♠7 of cards, the dealer will
give us new cards.
5 ♠5 ♣Q ♦J ♥3 ♠8
♦3 ♠7
I can play the J and take
all the cards…
… this goes on until all
cards are played
